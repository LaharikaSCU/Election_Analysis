# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

Build a Python script to analyse a recent local congressional election results provided by Colorado Board Election to help with audit. The final script when run will provide with below details needed by the election commision to complete the audit.

- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Winner of the election based on populate vote
- Voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with highest turnout

## Resources

- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.9, Visual Studio Code, 1.50.1

## Audit Results

The analysis results of the election showed that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the electio
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes
- "Denver" was the largest turnout county with a turnout percentage of 82.8% with 306,055 votes among a total votes of 369,711
    

## Audit Summary
The Python script is very useful for Election commision to quickly complete the audit with the needed outcomes. The Python script will be more useful to work for any elections with slight modifications such as 
   - ability to accept election results input file path as a parameter
   - ability to write analysis results output file path as a parameter
